Lesson 1 Reflexions: 

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can easily go back to previous codes/ processes.
	Can use to find bug in a later version of code.

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can manage it easier and easier for other people to follow changes
	Pros: (When using Git) Can access on any computer
	Cons: It takes more time than automatically save 
	Cons: Forget to save? 

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Organization. Instead of having 10 versions of one file, just have one file
	that has the ability to go back to previous commits. 

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    WINDOWS: cd folder_name> FC file_old file_new
	
	GIT/LINUX: cd folder_name
				diff -u file_old file_new

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to a previous version if the code breaks. 
	
-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
	Only have one file in which you can revert and/or compare to previous versions. 
	
-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Load the file you want to view: cd file_directory
	git log => can use to see all of the commits throughout the entire repository
	git diff old_file_id new_file_id => use to compare changed between two commits within the repository
										green lines were added and red lines were removed between the 
										two commits. 
					
-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	To use version-control and switch between different versions use: 
		git checkout commit_id
	This will revert the git log up until this commit. To revert back to the most recent commit, you
	must use git checkout commit_id --> but you must remember this. Will learn more about later!
